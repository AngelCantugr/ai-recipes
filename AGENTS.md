# Agent Guidelines for AI Recipes Repository

## Repository Purpose
Documentation repository containing AI prompt recipes for software engineering tasks, organized in food-themed categories (appetizers, mains, sides, desserts, ingredients).

## Build/Test/Lint Commands
This is a documentation-only repository with no build or test commands.
- Validate markdown formatting by reading files directly
- Use standard markdown conventions (CommonMark/GitHub-flavored)

## Code Style (Documentation)
**File Structure**:
- Organize by food metaphor: appetizers/ (quick tasks), mains/ (substantial work), sides/ (supporting), desserts/ (polish), ingredients/ (reusable)
- Use kebab-case for file names: `code-exploration.md`, `technical-decision.md`

**Content Style**:
- Start each recipe with: Purpose, When to Use, Template, Tips sections
- Use clear section headers with emoji (## Purpose 🎯)
- Include practical examples and templates users can copy-paste
- Target Staff Engineer level responsibilities: architecture, leadership, code quality

**Tone**: Clear, practical, conversational. Focus on actionable guidance over theory.

**Naming**: Use descriptive file names that match the recipe purpose

**Organization**: Keep CATALOG.md synchronized with all recipes; update both when adding new content
