## Tips
- **Lead with impact**: Start with what matters most to your audience
- **Be specific**: Use numbers, dates, and concrete examples
- **Show, don't just tell**: Include metrics and data points
- **Make it scannable**: Use headers, bullets, bold for key points
- **One page means one page**: Ruthlessly edit to fit 500-600 words
- **Include visuals if helpful**: Simple diagrams or charts add clarity
- **End with action**: Make it clear what you're asking for
- **Tailor to audience**: Technical depth for engineers, business value for executives
- **Highlight risks honestly**: Builds credibility, shows you've thought it through
- **Use active voice**: Makes writing more direct and compelling
- **Test readability**: Can someone skim it in 2 minutes and understand?
- **Version for feedback**: Get input before final version
- **Include contact info**: Make follow-up easy

## Example Use Cases

**New Feature Proposal**:
```
I need a one-pager proposing adding GraphQL API support to our platform.

Context:
- Audience: Engineering VP and Product Director
- Purpose: Get approval for Q3 roadmap inclusion
- Key decision: Approve 6-week project
- Constraints: Team of 3, must not impact current deliverables

Current situation: Partners requesting GraphQL, REST API becoming complex
Proposed: Add GraphQL layer alongside REST
Benefits: Better partner experience, reduced API complexity, modern stack
Risks: Learning curve, maintaining two APIs initially
Resources: 3 engineers, 6 weeks
Timeline: Design 1 week, implement 3 weeks, docs/testing 2 weeks
Success: 3 partners migrate in 3 months, 50% reduction in API calls

Create persuasive one-pager for executive approval.
```

**Technical Architecture Decision**:
```
I need a one-pager documenting our decision to adopt Kubernetes.

Context:
- Audience: Engineering team and infrastructure leadership
- Purpose: Inform and align on architectural direction
- Key decision: Already made, documenting rationale
- Constraints: Migration over 6 months

Document our Kubernetes adoption decision covering:
- Problem: Current deployment complexity, scaling challenges
- Solution: Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Benefits: Better scalability, improved developer experience, industry standard
- Approach: Phased migration starting with new services
- Timeline: 6 month transition
- Training: Team workshops, 2 weeks onboarding per engineer

Tone: Technical but accessible, confident but realistic about challenges.
```

**Incident Summary**:
```
I need a one-pager summarizing yesterday's database outage for leadership.

Context:
- Audience: CTO, VP Eng, Executive team
- Purpose: Inform on what happened, actions taken, prevention plan
- Tone: Factual, accountable, forward-looking

Incident: Database primary failover failed, 45 min outage
Impact: All services down, 10K users affected, ~$15K revenue impact
Cause: Misconfigured replication lag monitoring
Resolution: Manual failover, restored in 45 minutes
Prevention: Automated failover testing, improved monitoring, runbook updates
Timeline: Detection 2min, diagnosis 15min, resolution 28min

Create clear, executive-friendly incident summary.
```
