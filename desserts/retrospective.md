## Template

```
Help me facilitate a productive retrospective for [sprint/project/time period].

Context:
- Team: [who's participating]
- Time period: [what we're reflecting on]
- Major work: [key initiatives or themes]
- Notable events: [releases, incidents, changes]

Retrospective Format:
[ ] What Went Well / What Didn't / Actions
[ ] Start / Stop / Continue
[ ] 4Ls (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For)
[ ] Sailboat (Wind/Anchors/Rocks/Goals)

Please help me structure:

1. **Opening**
   - Set the stage and tone
   - Review action items from last retro
   - Establish psychological safety

2. **What Went Well** 🎉
   - Successes to celebrate
   - Effective practices to continue
   - Positive surprises
   - What made us proud

3. **What Didn't Go Well** 🤔
   - Challenges faced
   - Friction points
   - Missed expectations
   - Frustrations

4. **Lessons Learned** 📚
   - New insights gained
   - Assumptions challenged
   - Skills developed
   - Knowledge gaps identified

5. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - For major issues, dig deeper
   - What systemic factors contributed?
   - What patterns do we see?

6. **Action Items** 🎯
   - Specific, actionable improvements
   - Owner for each action
   - Timeline/deadline
   - How we'll measure success
   - Prioritize - don't overcommit

7. **Appreciate** 💙
   - Call out great work
   - Thank teammates
   - Recognize growth

Discussion Prompts:
- What surprised you this sprint?
- What should we keep doing?
- What should we try differently?
- What's slowing us down?
- What would make our work more enjoyable?
- What did we learn about our users/product?
- How's our code quality trending?
- How's team morale?
- What help do we need?

Make it:
- Safe to share honest feedback
- Focused on systems, not individuals
- Action-oriented, not just venting
- Balanced (celebrate wins too)
- Time-boxed and structured
- Engaging for all participants

Anti-patterns to avoid:
- Blaming individuals
- Rehashing old issues without moving forward
- No concrete actions
- Same issues every retro (action items not followed up)
- Dominated by one voice
- Not addressing elephants in the room
```

## Tips
- Rotate facilitator for fresh perspectives
- Use different formats to keep it fresh
- Follow up on action items before next retro
- Keep it blameless and constructive
- Make sure everyone participates
- Document outcomes and actions
- Share learnings with other teams
- Track trends over multiple retros
- End on a positive note
