# Code Exploration 🔍

## Purpose
Quickly understand an unfamiliar codebase or component

## When to Use
- Starting work on a new area of the codebase
- Onboarding to a new project
- Investigating legacy code
- Preparing for a code review

## Template

```
I need to understand [specific component/module/file]. Please help me:

1. Provide a high-level overview of what this code does
2. Identify the main entry points and key functions/classes
3. Explain the data flow and dependencies
4. Point out any unusual patterns or potential concerns
5. Suggest what I should investigate further

Context:
- Codebase: [programming language/framework]
- My goal: [what you're trying to accomplish]
- My current understanding: [what you already know]

[Paste code or provide file path]
```

## Tips
- Start with high-level architecture before diving into details
- Focus on understanding "why" decisions were made, not just "what" the code does
- Ask follow-up questions about specific sections that seem complex
- Use this as a foundation before making changes
