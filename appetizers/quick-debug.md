## Template

```
I'm debugging an issue and need help narrowing down the root cause.

Problem:
[Describe what's going wrong - be specific about symptoms]

Expected Behavior:
[What should happen]

Context:
- Environment: [dev/staging/prod]
- Recent changes: [any deployments, config changes, etc.]
- Frequency: [always/intermittent/specific conditions]

Error Messages/Logs:
[Paste relevant errors, stack traces, or log excerpts]

What I've tried:
[List debugging steps already taken]

Please help me:
1. Identify the most likely root causes
2. Suggest diagnostic steps to confirm or rule out each cause
3. Recommend what to investigate next
```

## Tips
- Include as much context as possible upfront
- Attach full stack traces, not just error messages
- Mention what you've already ruled out
- Be specific about timing - when did this start?
